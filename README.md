# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Using Supervise Machine Learning to Predict Credit Risk

## Background

### Overview of Analysis

This project consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report:

- Deliverable 1: Perform ETL on Amazon Product Reviews

- Deliverable 2: Determine Bias of Vine Reviews

- Deliverable 3: A Written Report on the Analysis (README.md)


### Purpose

To analize Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review.

In this project, we will choose 1 dataset from approximately 50 datasets. Then we will use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Then, use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in your dataset. 

## Resources

Data source:

- (1) Amazon_Reviews_ETL_starter_code, (2) challenge_schema

Software:

- Google Colab, AWS RDS, pgAdmin 6.14, Visual Studio Code 1.71.2
 
<br/>

## Methodology

### D1: Perform ETL on Amazon Product Reviews

<br/>

We chose an [Amazon_reviews_dataset](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt) to be analyzed. All the datasets had the same schemata, as shown in this image below:

<br/>

### The customers_table DataFrame:

Created the customers_table, using the code in the Amazon_Reviews_ETL_starter_code.ipynb file and following the steps below to aggregate the reviews by customer_id.

- Used the groupby() function on the customer_id column of the DataFrame.

- Counted all the customer ids using the agg() function by chaining it to the groupby() function. After we used this function, a new column was created, count(customer_id).

- Rename the count(customer_id) column using the withColumnRenamed() function so it matches the schema for the customers_table in pgAdmin.

### The products_table DataFrame:

To create the products_table, we used the select() function to select the product_id and product_title, then droped duplicates with the drop_duplicates() function to retrieve only unique product_ids.

### The review_id_table DataFrame:

To create the review_id_table, we used the select() function to select the columns that are in the review_id_table in pgAdmin and convert the review_date column to a date.

### The vine_table DataFrame:

To create the vine_table, we used the select() function to select only the columns that are in the vine_table in pgAdmin

### D2:Determine Bias of Vine Reviews

Using PySpark:

- Filtered the data and created a new DataFrame or table to retrieve all the rows where the total_votes count is equal to or greater than 20.

- Filtered the new DataFrame or table created in Step 1 and created a new DataFrame or table to retrieve all the rows where the number of helpful_votes divided by total_votes is equal to or greater than 50%.

- Filtered the DataFrame or table created in Step 2, and created a new DataFrame or table that retrieves all the rows where a review was written as part of the Vine program (paid), vine == 'Y'.

- Repeat Step 3, but this time retrieved all the rows where the review were not part of the Vine program (unpaid), vine == 'N'.

- Determined the total number of reviews, the number of 5-star reviews, and the percentage of 5-star reviews for the two types of review (paid vs unpaid), as shown in Figure (f).

## Results:
#### Refer to figure(f) above

- Q1. How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?

    - A1. There were **170** Vine reviews and **37,840** non_Vine reviews.

- Q2. How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

    - A2. There were **65** 5 star Vine reviews and **20,612** 5 star non-Vine reviews.

- Q3. What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?

    - A3. **38.24%** of the 5 star reviews were Vine and **54.47%** of 5 star reviews were non-Vine.


## Summary

Ho: 5star_vine = 5star_not_vine, there is no difference in the percenage(proportion) of 5star ratings paid(vine) vs unpaid(not vine).

Ha: 5star_vine <> 5star_not_vine, there is a difference in the percenage(proportion) of 5star ratings paid(vine) vs unpaid(not vine).

- percentage_5star_vine = **38.24%**
 
- percentage_5star_not_vine = **54.47%**
 
- **findings: the percentage of 5 star rating is not the same when comparing vine reviews to not_vine reviews**, figure (f).
 
- **There is reason to believe that the percentage of 5 star raitings is not directly tied to whether the review is paid or unpaid.**
 
- Additional analysis should be perform to evaluate the hypothesis test comparing the proportion of 5 star reviews among the two samples.
